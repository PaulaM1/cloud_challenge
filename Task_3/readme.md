1) In **Task number 3**, the goal was to learn the basics of the Python programming language and Cloud Function.
    * Firstly I Created Cloud Function in GCP Console. Choosed as a trigger to my function from the browser -> HTTP.
    * Then in the Editor, chose enviroment to run the code = Python3.7 from the Runtime dropdown.
    * I edited a little the code in main.py file (file of the program). It was edited - text: "Hello Word" to some other text.
    * Then I copied URL from the Trigger tab and pasted it into browser. At this time when I called the URL, it triggered the run of the function (the code in the function was executed).
    
    To try some more trigger option:
    * I edited the Functions -> file main.py, which I deployed before. New function showed current time.
    * Then I triggered my function again.
    * At the end I pasted the trigger URL to my function in **Task_3** file in my cloud_challenge repository and saved it.
